## About

I am a senior year student at Zhejiang University and UIUC, pursuing a degree in **Computer Engineering**. My current interests lie in **Machine Learning Systems** and **AI infrastructure**, particularly optimizing **LLM inference**.

I am starting to write [blog]({{ '/blog/' | relative_url }}) here.
